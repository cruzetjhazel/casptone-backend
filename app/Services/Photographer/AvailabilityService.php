/**
 * A date is bookable by default — it only becomes unavailable if the
 * photographer has explicitly blocked it (BlockedDate, full-day or partial)
 * or a Booking with a CONFIRMED payment already occupies the requested time.
 * Approval of any booking request is still entirely up to the photographer;
 * this service only determines whether a request can be *sent* for a given
 * date/time.
 *
 * Business rule (see SlotConflictService for the full rationale): a slot is
 * only ever truly "taken" once a booking for it has a confirmed payment
 * (partially or fully paid). A Pending request, or an accepted-but-unpaid
 * Confirmed booking, must NOT remove the slot from the public calendar —
 * otherwise a second client could never even submit a competing request,
 * which would make the system first-come-first-served in practice despite
 * CreateBookingAction explicitly allowing multiple overlapping requests.
 * getAvailableStartTimes() is also what CreateBookingAction::
 * assertSlotIsAvailable() checks a new request's start time against, so
 * this one filter keeps the calendar and the booking-creation guard in
 * sync automatically.
 *
 * Bookable hours for a date come from two layers, both optional:
 *  - BookingHour: the photographer's recurring "usual hours" per weekday
 *    (multiple periods per day supported, e.g. 6-12 and 2-8). If a
 *    photographer has never configured any BookingHour rows, every day
 *    defaults to fully open (00:00-24:00) for backward compatibility. Once
 *    at least one BookingHour row exists, any weekday with none stays
 *    closed for that reason (e.g. "Sunday: unavailable").
 *  - AvailabilityWindow: a one-off ADDITIVE period for one specific date,
 *    layered on top of whatever BookingHour resolves to that day — e.g. a
 *    photographer normally closed Sundays opening up one specific Sunday.
 *
 * BlockedDate (full-day or partial) still carves out unavailable time from
 * whatever periods result above, same as before.
