/**
 * DEMO/TESTING ONLY. Fills the gaps the other showcase seeders leave, with
 * exactly ONE row per scenario (no repeats):
 *
 *   - Reviews:  5 / 4 / 3 / 2 / 1 stars, with and without a photographer
 *               reply, and one review the photographer reported to admin.
 *   - Payments: the one payment state BookingStatesShowcaseSeeder lacks
 *               (full payment manually verified by admin).
 *   - Reports:  8 reports covering every target type, status (submitted,
 *               under review, resolved, closed), severity and requested
 *               action, from both clients and photographers.
 *   - Admin:    one account per moderation case (suspended + pending appeal,
 *               suspended + denied appeal, reinstated after approved appeal,
 *               self-deactivated).
 *
 * Booking and payment states live in BookingStatesShowcaseSeeder; this seeder
 * does not duplicate them. Rows are marked "MATRIX:" so re-running deletes and
 * recreates them (idempotent).
